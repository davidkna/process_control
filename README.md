# Process Control

This crate allows terminating a process without a mutable reference. Thus, it
becomes possible to abort early from waiting for output or an exit code â€“
primarily through [`ProcessTerminator::terminate`]. That method is
intentionally designed to not require a reference of any kind to the [`Child`]
instance, to allow for maximal flexibility.

Typically, it is not possible to terminate a process during a call to
[`Child::wait`] or [`Child::wait_with_output`] in another thread, since
[`Child::kill`] takes a mutable reference. However, since this crate creates
its own termination method, there is no issue, and useful methods such as
[`Terminator::wait_for_output_with_timeout`] can exist.
